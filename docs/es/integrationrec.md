# Itegration Recommendations
When beginning the integration process of DetectID Digital Onboarding, consider the following:

The web services of DetectID Onboarding must be summoned through 2 different requests with a few seconds between each. 

1.	Startup request 
2.	Process validation request

All the operations documented in this manual will be divided in these two types of requests and this must be considered when carrying out the integration process.
