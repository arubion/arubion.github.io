# End-user Photo Recommendations
When configuring DetectID Digital Onboarding to take photos of end-users, consider the following:

- Much like the photograph of the identification document, the selfie cannot be rotated or skewed. If this condition is not met, the DetectID Onboarding Image Processor will not be able to process it
- The user must be facing forward, towards the camera lens. The user must not be wearing any kind of external element or accessory, like, glasses, headphones/earphones, scarves, or any other object that may interfere with the validation process.
- It is recommended to conduct the image capture in a place with diffuse warm light. These are the ideal lighting conditions.
- It is necessary to avoid projecting any sort of shadow over the users face during the image capture process.
- Please avoid backlit condition during the image capture process.
- Only the user must be in the forefront of the photograph.
