# ID Photo Recommendations
When configuring DetectID Digital Onboarding to take photos of identification documents, consider the following:

## Position of the document

The photograph of the identification document must be perfectly horizontal, parallel to the camera lens. Any sort of rotation may have a negative impact on the reading of certain elements on the ID, like the PDF417 and MRZ codes.

</p>

## Lighting
The photograph of the identification document must not have any sort of flash or reflection. If this condition is not met, the accuracy of the processed data will be affected.

</p>

It is recommended to take the photograph of the document in a well-lighted location. Any sort of shadow over the document may affect negatively the accuracy of the processed data
