Features DetectID Digital Onboarding offers the following features by using photos of the end-user and his or her identification document (ID). Secure facial similarity evaluation: This process assigns a value to the comparison between a front photograph of the user and the one that can be found in the user\u2019s ID. The API conducts this validation in parallel to liveness detection to prevent print (enrollment using a photograph of the user) and video (enrollment using a video of the user) type attacks. Document security validation: DetectID Digital Onboarding API can calculate the possibility whether a document is authentic or not by verifying the document\u2019s security elements and predefined proportions between them.
