Lumu is an innovative web-based technology that provides a clear way to see, access and analyze this host of information that could be instrumental in revealing whether the company or organization is the target of one of these undesirable circumstances. Starting to use Lumu is very quick and easy, if you already have an account, log in to your Lumu Portal using your credentials, or register using a corporate email address. Once you have logged in to to your Lumu Portal, there are two very important steps we have to carry out to start using Lumu: 1. Adding a public gateway : In the context of Lumu, a public gateway is defined by the public IP space of the organization. The organization's IP address will be used to identify and analyze all the outgoing traffic that goes through the public gateway. 2. Point your DNS to Lumu : To use the services of Lumu, it is necessary to configure your DNS settings to use Lumus recursive DNS service. Change the DNS settings of your Operating System, firewall and/or router to stop using your Internet service provider's (ISP) default DNS and configure Lumu's instead. Lumu supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Detailed instructions to carry out these procedures will be provided in this portal, so let us begin.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"#getting-started","text":"Many companies and organizations may be victims of diverse threats and attacks; however, they may not have access to the right information that could make them aware of the situation they may find themsleves in.

This is how our DNS services help your company find out if their traffic and security are compromised. Now, it is time to configure your DNS settings to point them towards Lumu's DNS services. The following video will guide you through the configuration process: These are Lumu's IPv4 DNS addresses: 50.17.0.10 3.87.85.24 There are two options to change ypur DNS settings: Hardware configuration : It is possible to configure directly the router provided by your ISP so all connections stablished from that device are redirected through Lumu's DNS services; however, there is a distinct possibility that the ISP's DNS is hardcoded into the device. If that were to happen, t would be necessary to configure the DNS on each device individually. Every router brand and/or model has different firmware and configurable options, so it is suggested to research your particular router modem to change the DNS settings correctly using the addresses provided above. OS configuration : Each device must be configured individually using the configurable settings of each operating system. The procedure to carry this out depends on the OS of each device.
