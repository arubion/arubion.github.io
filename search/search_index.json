I decided to write a review of a videogame I had started playing at the time named Paladins. The reason I opted to write this sort of content was that I could show a certain amount of technical knowledge while still showing my writing skills and knowledge of the English language. It is worth mentioning this was only the first stage of the admission process and it was originally written in September of 2017. Paladins: Champions of the Realm Introduction With certain frequency, a new game appears and becomes a big hit, a blockbuster, if you will. Said games redefine the market, at least in the foreseeable future. When World of Warcraft was released, forgive my cheekiness for putting it this way, it changed the game for all the video game studios interested in producing a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG for short). There was a new standard, and thus, everyone decided to emulate, or at least try, the most successful formula they knew at the time. The original king of the mountain: World of Warcraft The videogame market soon became flooded with clones and attempts to capitalize on the success of Blizzard\u2019s Entertainment MMORPG, however, few managed to replicate a portion of the success reached by WoW. In many cases though, a portion of that success was more than enough to be considered a success in on itself, which was the reasoning behind the birth of many mediocre games that followed after WoW\u2019s footsteps. This isn\u2019t a new occurrence, or even exclusive to MMORPGs or PC gaming. Whenever something exceptionally successful in any media or platform appears, it will be replicated by someone else, to the point where that which made it special becomes dull, if only because of repetition. As stated at the beginning, every now and then, there\u2019s a new king of the mountain, and the current king of the mountain is Blizzard\u2019s most recent creation: Overwatch. As expected, many team based arena shooters appeared soon after to try and mooch off of the game\u2019s success, some more successful than others, of course. This is the point where the main topic of this review appears. Overwatch, Blizzard's world famous hero shooter Hi-Rez studios is a videogame studio known for its immensely popular, yet short-lived hit games, such as TRIBES: Ascend and Global Agenda . Their most recent creation at the time had been Smite , their own take on the MOBA/ARTS subgenre. And when the new king of the mountain\u2019s steps could be heard in the distance, Hi-Rez decided to try their hand at doing what they did best: borrowing a concept and trying to put their own spin on it. Creating something that was familiar, yet different enough to be recognizable on its own. And that way Paladins: Champions of the realm was created and slated for release not too far from the actual release date of Overwatch. As it was to be expected, Paladins couldn\u2019t replicate Overwatch\u2019s overwhelming economic success and recognition, however it has a dedicated player base, constant technical support and development, and of course, a lot of positive reviews. Unfortunately, there has always been a nasty shadow looming every milestone and goal reached by Paladins: It has always been called a mediocre and uninspired free-to-play Overwatch clone. Thus, we ask ourselves the big question: Is it really? There are some undeniable similarities, of course The purpose of this review is to find an answer to said question and judge the game based on its actual characteristics and features. If possible, further from the emotional veil that could be the perpetual Overwatch comparison. This review will analyze four different aspects of the game according to my experience and opinion to finally offer a conclusion. These will be: Technical aspects Gameplay, Design and monetization At the end, at least according to my judgment, we\u2019ll see if Paladins is worth playing or if it is another worthless Overwatch clone destined for failure. Technical aspects On a technical level, Paladins isn\u2019t as polished as its triple-A Blizzard counter-part. This is one of the aspects where Hi-Rez does poorly very frequently. Paladins works and is optimized enough to run smoothly on low-end computers; however, glitches and bugs can be found rather often, some which could make the game unplayable, at least for the match when they occur. An example of these are a very particular and short freeze which occurs right after the first minute mark for everyone in the match and a glitch in which textures and animations will freeze in such a way that nothing is visible on the screen, forcing the player to restart the game and turn-off DX12 support. One of the problems frequently found by players, and which has been addressed in different support threads online, is the way the game runs, not on low-end computer, but on the middle of the spectrum. Inexplicable FPS drops on computers that shouldn\u2019t suffer them are actually rather frequent. When finding said problem, the most intuitive solution would be to set the game to low or minimum settings; however, in the case of Paladins, that isn\u2019t so. Paladins is rather intensive in the usage of processing power, so when setting the game to minimum, the actual performance gain may be negligible. The reason is actually fairly simple. Since the game is processor intensive, when set to minimum, it will stop using the GPU and will put the entire load on the processor . A mid-range processor may not be able to run the game smoothly by itself, as a consequence, the game\u2019s performance may be seriously affected. The actual solution would be to set the game to high or maximum settings, that way the strain is split more evenly between the processor and the GPU which increases performance greatly and makes FPS drops a non-issue. The fact that the game isn\u2019t very polished may be forgiven if only because of the fact that it\u2019s still in beta testing phase. If these problems continue when the game is officially released, it would be an egregious offense. Another issue that is worth noting is the quality of Hi-Rez servers. Hi-Rez servers are easily strained and overloaded. They stop working very easily, which interrupts or outright ends matches with no solution whatsoever. On a bad day, servers can go down many times in one gaming session, and it\u2019s even possible to exploit and manipulate them to escape from a match that you\u2019re losing. Drop-hacks aren\u2019t uncommon, and if you have ever experienced them, you would know they\u2019re a blight for every game community they touch. Server quality is very important to maintain a constant and healthy player-base, and if it isn\u2019t improved quickly, it may compromise one of the most important aspects for the survival of the game. Gameplay This is where Paladins shines, and in many people\u2019s opinion, outshines its competition. The gameplay is surprisingly fun and kinetic and every character feels unique and fun. Fun is an inescapable word when describing Paladins\u2019 gameplay. The interface and view-models are displayed in a similar fashion to any other first person shooter, so it\u2019s an already familiar experience. I would need to compare it to Overwatch to make my point clearly understood: When playing Overwatch, many characters despite having totally different roles may feel similar. A tank has tank-like skills, but in general has regular bulk compared with other characters. Some characters have been redesigned with that in mind, and because of that lost viability in the meta-game. This is purely speculation on my part, but this may come from a need to keep the game slightly balanced on a 1v1 level, making it possible for any character to stand toe-to-toe with any other character. This is a respectable decision, but one that I didn\u2019t particularly enjoy. In Paladins though, the 1V1 balance between roles is almost totally forgone, resulting in amazingly fun characters and a focus on team-play that suited my tastes a lot more. Having said that, it\u2019s a matter of preference, and as an individual, I prefer Hi-Rez\u2019 take on the idea. This design philosophy may come with its drawbacks, for example, very unbalanced characters may appear once in a while, but seeing how fun the game actually is, I think it\u2019s worth the risk. Design If I were to judge the game purely based on how polished the aesthetic of the game is, I would judge Overwatch the superior game of the two, and in many ways it is. Overwatch\u2019s visual concept is leaps and bounds beyond that of Paladins. The characters are very attractive and have been refined to near-perfection, however this may have to do with the fact that said visual design and identity had been previously created for Titan, a cancelled MMORPG that was being made by the company before Overwatch. Compared to such refinement, Paladins pales in comparison. However, I will not judge Paladins only based on polish, because there\u2019s a point in particular where it surpasses Overwatch: charm. Overwatch\u2019s characters are efficient and well made, but bar a few exceptions, their personalities are a bit flat, generic and, there I say, boring. And that is okay, the game is polished in many other aspects, and this is also a matter of opinion. Paladins though, is where I\u2019ve seen characters with the most individuality. Characters in paladins are amazingly fun, and in most cases, totally different from one another. Characters like Fernando, speaking Spanglish and putting his \u201clatino heat\u201d on every line and action, make the gameplay experience very enjoyable. Gameplay-wise, characters like Makoa for example, may be very similar to characters from Overwatch, Roadhog in this case. But when taking into account Makoa\u2019s design and personality, his lines, skills and voice-work, I\u2019d be forced to say that playing Paladins\u2019 oversized turtle is the better experience of the two. Not all of Paladins\u2019 characters are a hit, of course, some are very mediocre and bland. But seeing Hi-Rez\u2019 Character design at its best makes is totally worth bearing with their worst. Ferrrrnando! Monetization Paladins is a free-to-play game and it delivers on that promise. Everything necessary to play the game is either available from the beginning or can be obtained through playing the game. All of the champions can be purchased with in-game currency and cards, which can be used to change the way your favorite champion is played, are unlocked through playing as well. Even, many cosmetics can be unlocked simply by playing or by opening chests using in-game currency, so it\u2019s even a bit generous if anything. The game will only charge you for some premium packs, which are a very good deal, and for cosmetics. The fact that all champions present and future, can be unlocked with a single payment is very attractive to me as well, and separates it from some games with similar business models. My only complaint lies with chests. The fact that some of the coolest cosmetics in the game are trapped by a randomly generated number lottery is a bit frustrating, to say the least. If these cosmetic items were readily available for purchase in the premium store, Paladins\u2019 monetization model would be perfect, hands down. Paladins has one of the best free-to-play monetization models found in PC gaming, and with some tuning it could be the best, at least from those I know. Conclusion Is Paladins an Overwatch clone? Yes, or at least that\u2019s how it started. Gameplay-wise, many of Paladins\u2019 characters are very similar, if not, an outright copy and paste from Overwatch\u2019s characters. Like Fernando and Reinhardt, Makoa and Roadhog, or Viktor and Soldier 76. But after more than a year, both games have split ways and taken very different directions. This has been to Paladins benefit in my opinion, since it gave an alternative to people who wanted to play a team based battle arena shooter, but didn\u2019t like Blizzard\u2019s take on it. Paladins: Champions of the Realm may have started as a clone, but it plays and feels different enough to stand on its own as a different game which doesn\u2019t deserve to be in the shadow of the giant that is Overwatch. On a technical level, the game needs a lot of improvement, and hopefully many of its issues will be ironed out throughout the Beta testing phase, specially the quality of the servers, since this in particular hurts the game\u2019s reputation and player base. At this point in time, Overwatch and Paladins are very different games with different design philosophies and gameplay. If you\u2019re more interested on individual play and overall polish, Overwatch Is your game, but if you\u2019re interests in very fun team-based gameplay, unique and entertaining characters which don\u2019t take themselves too seriously, and last but not least, not paying a dime, Paladins is most definitely your game. Paladins: Champions of the Realm, isn\u2019t a perfect game by no means, but it is a very good game on its own right and not just an Overwatch clone. It\u2019s fantastic to play with friends and it\u2019s more than worth to try out and spend some of your time on.

General Recommendations Identification Document Photo To use the THE PRODUCT correctly, it is important to know that the photograph of the identification document must fulfill a few conditions. Bear in mind the following advice when taking said photograph: The photograph of the identification document must be perfectly horizontal, parallel to the camera lens. Any sort of rotation may have a negative impact on the reading of certain elements on the ID, like the PDF417 and MRZ codes. The photograph of the identification document must not have any sort of flash or reflection. If this condition is not met, the accuracy of the processed data will be affected. It is recommended to take the photograph of the document in a well-lighted location. Any sort of shadow over the document may affect negatively the accuracy of the processed data. End User Photo (selfie) To use PRODUCT correctly, it is important to know that the photograph of the end user (selfie) must fulfill a few conditions. Bear in mind the following advice when taking said photograph: Much like the photograph of the identification document, the selfie cannot be rotated or skewed. If this condition is not met, the DetectID Onboarding Image Processor will not be able to process it The user must be facing forward, towards the camera lens. The user must not be wearing any kind of external element or accessory, like, glasses, headphones/earphones, scarves, or any other object that may interfere with the validation process. It is recommended to conduct the image capture in a place with diffuse warm light. These are the ideal lighting conditions. It is necessary to avoid projecting any sort of shadow over the users face during the image capture process. Only the user must be in the forefront of the photograph. Image Transfer Parameters The following are the recommended parameters of the files that are going to be sent through the services of THE PRODUCT. Configure these values accordingly to ensure the proper functioning of the product. Note : Bear in mind that the dimensions and quality of the transferred files have an inverse relation with response times. It is necessary to find an adequate balance between image quality and response times, according to THE CUSTOMER's use case.

Since we're all starting to delve into the territory of online documentation, I think it's necessary to start learning about the tools that we are going to be using throughout this process, so, this article will focus in Markdown and MkDocs. Let us begin. Markdown Simply put, Markdown is a series of conventions that simplifies the use of HTML to create simple yet good-looking sites. Markdown is specially useful when it comes to READMEs and documentation in general. As a matter of fact, using Markdown to build documentation is pretty much the industry standard, so learning this ability will be very useful for any current or future technical documentation activities, and you'll be happy to know that Markdown supports HTML syntax, so all the HTMl stuff we learned some time ago will be very useful. Luckily for us, Markdown is simple enough to learn and use and there are a whole lot of resources online to learn and master it very quickly. I'll compile some of these resources here to get you on your way to become a Markdown expert. Text / Source Code Editor This is more of a preliminary step. A Text / Source code editor is necessary to create and edit Markdown files (.md), even something like Notepad can get the job done, but just like using a frying pan to hammer down some nails, there are way better tools for the job. I would suggest installing either Microsfot Visual Studio Code (the one I use) or Atom. Both offer excellent features that may come in extremely handy when writing Markdown, such as Markdown syntax preview. Install and familiarize yourself with your tool of choice before going any deeper. Both editors are completely free. Markdown Tutorial This is an interactive site designed to learn the basics of Markdown. It will guide you through a series of excercises and activities that will help you learn a lot about this tool. It does not take long and you will familiarize yourself with the most basic aspects of Markdown. It isn't the most in-depth look, but it is a good starting point. Markdown Cheatsheet This convenient guide offers instructions to carry out different formatting configurations with their corresponding examples. When in doubt about how to format anything, this guide may come extremely handy. StackEdit This is pretty much a live Markdown demo. it allows to see the syntax and results live on the site. It is also a very good resource when learning how to use Markdown to write documentation. There are many more resources to be found on the net, but they are as diverse in content and quality as your writing and formatting needs. Learning to look for resources is also a part of mastering Markdown. Simply put, it's time to train your Google-Fu! MkDocs MkDocs is a static website generator; that is, a tool that can be used to create simple and good looking static websites very easily. This is the tool that we will use to create the online documentation for the solutions of the company. MkDocs is free and very easy to install, learn and use. I will take the chance to compile all the resources and components necessary to install and use MkDocs. MkDocs This is the main website of the tool. It contains the files, instructions and resources needed to install MkDocs on your PC, as well as additional resources such themes and plugins. This site holds everything you will need to build, configure and deploy your own static website, all without spending a single dime; however, it is also possible to find resources externally suited for different needs and themes. Python/PIP As you will find in the MkDocs installation process, it is necessary to install and/or update Python and PIP . The MkDocs installation instructions already provide steps and instructions to install these components, but I consider it's important to provide these two links to have them at hand. Bear in mind that MkDocs DOES NOT support the latest version of Python and the last supported version is Python 3.7 . Right after installing a supported version of Python, it is necessary to check the version of PIP and update it. You will find the instructions to carry out these procedures in the provided links. Themes MkDocs allows the use of themes to configure the visual aspect of the website. These themes are free, very easy to install and highly customizable. This feature allows us to select and use the theme we find most suitable for the purpose of the document and modify its appearance (color scheme, icons, the position of some components, etc.). The theme that we selected for the documentation demo is called Material, it has its own website with different resources to configure and deploy a site using it. Most of these themes have similar resources, both provided by their respective creators and other parties that have used them for their own documentation sites. These resources are at a hands reach if you know where to look, so the Google-Fu we talked about before will come in very handy. Examples Here, I will simply provide some examples of documentation sites that use MkDocs so you can see the tool in action, and some useful external resources. ZeroNet ZeroNet's line of business is very far from ours; however, they used the same tool as us to build their documentation and they are very open with the knowledge and technology they used to build their documentation site. You can find their documentation repository here along with the Readme they created for their site and other useful goodies. Markdown Crash Course Just a useful video about Markdown in case you're looking for more information about it or you're more of an audiovisual learner. Dougal Matthews - MkDocs: Documenting projects with Markdown Short conference in EuroPython 2015 about using this tool to create online documentation. It showcases how fast and easy it is, with the added bonus of legitimizing our use of the tool a bit because people respond well to that sort of thing. Well, this is it for now, hope you find this resource useful. Good luck and happy documenting!","title":"Markdown and MkDocs"},{"location":"mkdown_mkdocs/#markdown-and-mkdocs","text":"Hello!

These two features are one of our main tools while creating and maintaining documentation; however, they aren't very intuitive and exactly easy to use. Rejoyce, for your prayers have been answered! I'm about to teach you some key knowledge regarding these features. Hopefully, this will be enough to help you feel more familiar with the software and more confortable with your work. Let us begin. Styles Gallery The styles gallery contains a combination of predetermined and designed styles that can be assigned to different sections of text in a document. These styles can modify the size, font, spacing, numbering, etc. and by modifying the style itself, many paragraphs can be edited at the same time, simplifying the process and giving uniformity and order to the document. Styles are also very important when using Tables of Content, since the headings that are used to build the tables of our documents are assigned through this option. This feature can be found in the home tab; however, this is a simplified version of it. I recommend clicking in the highlighted option, as shown in the picture below, to see the full version of the gallery. Once the Style Gallery has popped out, a few more options will show on screen. Let's take a look at some of the most relevant options for our job: New Style This option allows to create new styles to be included in the document's Styles Gallery. To open this dialogue, click on the option that can be found at the bottom of the gallery as shown in the picture below. The following dialog box will pop up showing the following options: The options found in this box go as follows: Name : Identifier to be assigned to the new style. It is strongly recommended to give it a unique and easily identifiable name related to the purpose of the style. Style Type : Any newly created style must be set as a Paraghraph type style. To learn more about this characteristic, refer to the following link, more specifically, John McGhie's response. Style Based On : If a style is selected in this field, the newly created style will use the selected style's characteristics as the base for the new style. It also means that if the base style is modified afterwards, these modifications may carry over to the new style. Style for Following Paragraph : This field configures the style that is going to be used in the next paragraph. This could be specially helpful when creating a style that is going to be used as a title or heading, that way, the next paragraph can be set to Normal to save time. Formatting : This section contains the main configurable aspects of the style, like font, size, color, alignment, etc. However, it is worth remembering these aren't the only configurable aspects of the style. Preview : This window displays a preview of the style. Useful to modify some aspects of it while having an idea of how it will look. Format : This is where the rest of the configurable aspects of the style can be found. Any in-depth configuration, such as indentation, borders, spacing, types of numbering and bullets, shortcut keys (extremely useful and strongly recommended), among others, can be found here. This is one of the most useful aspects of the style creator, I recommend to practice and experiment with this menu. It offers many configuration possibilities, as shown in the image below. Modifying a Style This menu is also accessible when editing an existing style. To modify a style, locate the style that you want to modify in the Styles Gallery, then, right-click on the style and select Modify . Now, the Modify Style window should show on screen. This window has the same options as the Style creation window we saw in the previous section. When a style is modified, all instances of said style in the document should receive these modifications; however, it is strongly recommended to check each instance of the modified style individually. If the document is too large and checking every instance individually is too time-consuming, it is possible to manually apply the changes to all the instances of the style using the following procedure: Open the Style Gallery panel and look for the style that you just modified. If we right click on it when we look for the number of instances, we will find that MS Word doesn't have that information right now, so, we need to help Word acquire said information. Look for the Style Inspector icon at the bottom of the panel and click on it. If we right-click on the Style after the procedure is complete, we'll see that Word now has the number of instances of the style. Click on Select All X Instance(s) and then click on the style to apply it to the selected paragraphs. Update Style to Match Section If a style got corrupted, disconfigured or if you have modified a paragraph manually, it is possible to overwrite its with the parameters of a paragraph of our choice. First, locate and select the paragraph that we want to use to replace the style's settings with Look for the style that you want to update in the Styles Gallery, right-click on it and select the option Update [Style] to Match Selection. This will update the settings of the selected style to match the ones of the selected paragraph To make sure all the instances of the modified style have been updated, carry out the steps described in the previous section. List Styles The List Styles feature allows to organize and format different styles in the document. It offers a whole slew of possibilities; however, we are interested in one in particular, which is what we'll be going over this time around. Follow these instructions to create or edit a List Style. Access the List Styles menu, select the Home tab and look for the Multilevel List icon. There, either right-click on the List Style you wish to edit and select the Modify option, or click on Define New List Style. Multilevel List option Select Define New Style Now, a new window will pop up. This window looks very similar to the style creation window we saw above and some features may seem alike. The feature we're interested in is Numbering , which can be found in the Format submenu. A new window will show on screen; however, the infromation shown on it is a bit limited. Now, click on More , this will reveal a new panel in the window. Click on More List Styles Configuration Menu Now, let's take a look at the options this window offers: Levels : This numbers represent the 9 possible levels of the list. Each level may have its own format settings and style associated. For the purposes of this guide, we will make use of the first and second levels only. Preview : This window gives us a preview of our format settings. Link level to style: This drop-down menu allows us to link a style to the list level we are editing. Whatever format setting we assign to that level, will be reflected on all instances of that style in the document. Level 1: Assign the largest heading to this level. Normally, this would be Heading Mega, but it depends on the document. Level 2: Assign the second heading to this level. Normally, this would be Heading 1, but it depends on the document. Enter formatting for number/Include level number from : This setting allows us to change the format of that level's numbering. Some specific settings must be assigned here. Level 1: First, look at field 7, Number Style for this list and select 1, 2, 3... in the drop-down menu. A character should now appear in the Enter formatting for number field. Make sure to add a period right after the number on this field (1); however, due to other format settings, the content of this field will not be visible later on, but it must contain two characters, the number and the period. Include level number from will be disabled in level 1. Level 2: First, you'll notice that Include level number from is now enabled. Click on the drop-down menu and select Level 1. A character should now appear in the Enter formatting for number field, add a period right after this number. Now, look at field 7, Number Style for this list and select 1, 2, 3... in the drop-down menu. We should have three characters in the Enter formatting for number field, one number, one period and another number (1.1); however, due to other format settings, the content of this field will not be visible later on. Font : This option allows us to configure the font, size, color, etc. of the numbering for this level. Level 1: Font: Calibri, Font Style: Regular, Font Size: 72, Font Color: White/None. Disable everything else. Level 2: Font: Calibri, Font Style: Regular, Font Size: 48, Font Color: White/None. Disable everything else. Start at/Restart list after : These options are used to configure what number the list starts at and when it is restarted. Level 1: Configure the Start at field and set the value to 1. Restart list after is disabled for this level. Level 2: Configure the Start at field and set the value to 1. Select Level 1 in the Restart list after drop-down menu to restart the numbering after the next instance of the level 1 heading. Number style for this level : Addressed in point 4. Must be set to 1, 2, 3... in both levels by this point. Position : The options in this subsection allow to configure the position of the assigned headings in the document. Configure them as seen in the screenshots below: Level 1 Level 2 Hit OK in both windows. The List Style should be created by now. Now, browse the document and locate the first instance of the largest heading, that is, the beginning of the list, and assign the List Style by clicking the List Style icon in the Multilevel Lists section. This should assign the List Style to the document: however, if MS Word doesn't assign the List Style correctly, format any heading that needs the new format using the previous method. Remember that this list style can be treated as a numbered list, meaning that, it is possible to restart or continue numbering at will when required. That's it for today, feel free to ask any questions to your colleagues to learn more about the feature, but this guide should have provided the basics of it that we need to carry out our everyday duties.

This site was created to compile and store the team's knowledge regarding our main work tool: Microsoft Word. This text processor offers more possibilities than meets the eye, and has its own fair share of issues as well. Hopefully, the information found here can be used to help all of us when we're stuck on our day to day business. A disappearing or incorreclty updated table of contents is one of the most common issues in our documentation. Normally, this can be solved by creating a new Table of Contents from scratch. Here, you will find the necessary information to carry this procedure out. In the MS Word Ribbon, select the References tab, then, click on the Table of Contents option. Once there, select the Custom Table of Contents option. This will open a configuration screen. In this menu, click on Options. This new screen will allow you to configure the size and appearance of the styles that are used by MS Word to build the table of contents. The styles in this screen must be configured according to the desired appearance of the items in the table of contents. A value between 1 and 4 can be configured. 1 must be assigned to the largest style in the Table, normally, this would be Heading Mega or Heading 1, while 2 and 3 must be used for the next following styles in the Table of contents. 4 is reserved for Enf_Alca_Aud , since this value gives that style a special appearance.

This site was created to compile and store the team's knowledge regarding our main work tool: Microsoft Word. This text processor offers more possibilities than meets the eye, and has its own fair share of issues as well. Hopefully, the information found here can be used to help all of us when we're stuck on our day to day business. A disappearing or incorreclty updated table of contents is one of the most common issues in our documentation. Normally, this can be solved by creating a new Table of Contents from scratch. Here, you will find the necessary information to carry this procedure out. In the MS Word Ribbon, select the References tab, then, click on the Table of Contents option. Once there, select the Custom Table of Contents option. This will open a configuration screen. In this menu, click on Options. This new screen will allow you to configure the size and appearance of the styles that are used by MS Word to build the table of contents. The styles in this screen must be configured according to the desired appearance of the items in the table of contents. A value between 1 and 4 can be configured. 1 must be assigned to the largest style in the Table, normally, this would be Heading Mega or Heading 1, while 2 and 3 must be used for the next following styles in the Table of contents. 4 is reserved for Enf_Alca_Aud , since this value gives that style a special appearance.
